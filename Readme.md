# docker commands 
Docker is a containerization tool.
Virtualization -- Fixed hardware allocation.
Containerization - No Fixed Hardware
Process isolation ( Dependency in os is removed )

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

In comparison to the traditional virtualization functionalities of hypervisors, 
Docker containers eliminate the need for a separate guest operating system for every new virtual machine.

Docker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation. 

A Docker container enables rapid deployment with minimum run-time requirements. It also ensures better management and simplified portability.
 This helps developers and operations team in rapid deployment of an application.

Create Ubuntu Machine on AWS
All Traffic - anywhere

Connect using git bash

https://get.docker.com/


Go to Root Account
$ sudo  su -
# curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh ( this will download shell script in the machine)

# sh get-docker.sh  ( This will execute the shell script, which will install docker )

How to check the docker is installed or not

# docker --version

We should be comformatable with four terms

1) Docker Images   
Combinations of binaries / libraries which are necessary for one software application.

2) Docker Containers  
When image is installed and in comes into running condition, it is called container.



3) Docker Host
Machine on which docker is installed, is called as Docker host.

4) Docker Client
Terminal used to run docker run commands ( Git bash )



On linux machine, git bash will work like docker client.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Run command options 

-it 	for opening an interactive terminal in a container 


--name 	Used for giving a name to a container 

-d 	Used for running the container in detached mode as a background process 

-e 	Used for passing environment varaibles to the container 



-p 	Used for port mapping between port of container with the dockerhost port.

 
-P 	Used for automatic port mapping ie, it will map the internal port of the container 
                with some port on host machine. 
               This host port will be some number greater than 30000 

-v 	Used for attaching a volume to the container 

--volume-from 	 Used for sharing volume between containers 

--network 	Used to run the contianer on a specific network 
--link 		Used for linking the container for creating a multi container architecture 

--memory  	Used to specify the maximum amount of ram that the container can use

# docker images   ( There are no images )





To download tomcat image

# docker pull tomee


# docker images		

# docker pull ubuntu

If you do not specify the version, by default, we get latest version

I want to download jenkins
# docker pull jenkins


TO create a container from an image

#  docker run --name mytomcat  -p   7070:8080   tomee

     docker run   --name  c1   -p    7070:8080  tomee   





TO check the tomcat is running or not
http://13.250.47.90:7070

( 7070 is port number mapped in docker host)

Lets remove the container  ( Open another gitbash terminal)

# docker stop  c1


# docker rm -f c1

# docker run --name   mytomcat  -p 7070:8080   -d   tomee





( The above command  runs tomcat in detached mode , so we get out # prompt back )
 
# docker container ls

TO start jenkins
#  docker run --name myjenkins  -p 9090:8080    -d   jenkins








To check for jenkins ( Open browser )
 http://13.250.47.90:9090

To create ubuntu container
#  docker run --name myubuntu  -it ubuntu





Observation:  You have automatically entered into ubuntu
# ls  ( To see the list of files in ubuntu )
# exit  ( To comeout of container back to host )


+++++++++++++


Scenario 1:
Start tomcat as a container and name it as "webserver". Perform port mapping and run this container in detached mode

# docker run --name  webserver  -p 7070:8080  -d tomee

To access homepage of the tomcat container
Launch any browser
public_ip_of_dockerhost:7070

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++





Scenario 2:
Start jenkins as a container in detached mode , name is as "devserver", perform port mapping

# docker run -d  --name  devserver  -p 9090:8080 jenkins

To access home page of jenkins ( In browser)
public_ip_of_dockerhost:9090

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Scenario 3:  Start nginx as a container and name as "appserver", run this in detached mode ,   perform automatic port mapping 

Generally we pull the image and run the image

Instead of pulling, i directly   

# docker run --name  appserver  -P  -d  nginx 



( if image is not available, it perform pull operation automatically )
( Capital P  , will perform automatic port mapping )



How to check nginx is running or not? ( we do not know the port number)

To know the port that is reserved for nginx )
# docker port  appserver
80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:32768

80  is nginx port
32768  is  dockerhost port

or

#  docker container ls    ( to see the port of nginz and docker host )

To check nginx on browser
52.221.192.237:32768

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To start centos as container

# docker run --name mycentos  -it  centos
#  exit  ( To come back to dockerhost )

To start mysql  as container, open interactive terminal in it, create a sample table.



# docker run  --name  mydb  -d  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=sunil  mysql:5




# docker container ls

I want to open bash terminal of  mysql
# docker  exec   -it  mydb  bash

To connect to mysql database
#  mysql  -u  root  -p 

enter the password, we get mysql  prompt

TO see list of databases

Multi container architecture using docker
------------------------------------------
This can be done in  2  ways
1) --link
2) docker-compose


1)  --link option
----------------------


Use case:
--------------
Start two busybox containers and create link between them






Create 1st busy box container
# docker run --name c10 -it   busybox

/ # 

How to come out of the container without exit
( ctrl + p  + q)




Create 2nd busy box container  and establish link to c1 container
# docker run   --name  c20 --link c10:c10-alias  -it     busybox   ( c10-alias  is  alias name)

/ #





How to check  link is established for not?

/ #  ping c10

Ctrl +c  ( to come out from ping )

( ctrl + p  + q)

Ex 3:  Create LAMP  Architecture using docker

L -- linux
A -- apache tomcat
M -- mysql
P --  php

( Linux os we already have )









Lets remove all the docker containers
# docker rm  -f  $(docker ps -aq)

# docker container ls  (  we have no containers now )

1)  TO start mysql as container
# docker run --name mydb  -d  -e  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=sunil  mysql:5


2)  TO start tomcat as container

Creating testing environment using docker



Create selenium hub container, and link it with two node containers.
One node with firefox installed, another node with chrome installed.

Tester should be able to run selenuim automation programs for testing the application on multiple browsers.


To delete all the running containers
#		
In Browser  --  open - hub.docker.com

Search for selenium
We have a image -  selenium/hub

To start selenium/hub as container
# docker run --name  hub  -d -p 4444:4444   selenium/hub


In hub.docker.com
we also have-  selenium/node-chrome-debug    ( It is ubuntu container with chrome)

To start it as a container and link to hub ( previous container)
# docker run --name chrome  -d -p 5901:5900  --link hub:selenium   selenium/node-chrome-debug

In hub.docker.com
we also have-  selenium/node-firefox-debug

To start it as a container and link to hub ( It is ubuntu container with firefox)
# docker run --name firefox  -d -p 5902:5900  --link hub:selenium   selenium/node-firefox-debug

To see the list of container
# docker container ls

Note: firefox and chrome containers are GUI containers.

All the commands we learnt till date are adhoc commands.

In the previous usecase we have installed two containers ( chrome and firefox)
Lets say you need 80 containers?
Do we need to run 80 commands?
 
Instead of 80 commands, we can use docker compose

++++++++++++++++++++++++


Docker compose
This is a feature of docker using which we can create multicontainer architecture using yaml files. This yaml file contains information about the  containers that we want to launch and how they have to be linked with each other.Yaml is a file format. It is not a scripting language.
Yaml will store the data in key value pairs
Lefthand side - Key
Righthand side - Value
Yaml file is space indented.




Sample Yaml file

durgasoft:
 trainers:
  sunil: Devops
  raj: Python
 Coordinators:
  lakshmi: Devops

Docker volumes
------------------
Docker containers are  ephemeral ( temporary )
Where as the data processed by the container should be permanent.

Generally, when a container is deleted all its data will be lost.
To preserve the data, even after deleting the container, we use volumes.

Volumes are of two types
1) Simple docker volumes
2) Docker volume containers ( Sharable volume )




Simple docker volumes
-----------------------------
These volumes are used only when we want to access the data, 
even after the container is deleted. 
But this data cannot be shared with other containers.



usecase
------------
1) Create a directory called /data ,  
start centos as container and mount /data as volume. 
Create files in mounted volume in centos container,
exit from the container and delete the container. Check if the files are still available.




Lets create a folder  with the name  
# mkdir  /data

# docker run --name c1 -it -v /data centos  ( v option is used to attach volume)

# ls  ( Now, we can see the data folder also in the container)

# cd data
# touch file1   file2 
# ls
# exit  ( To come out of the container )
# docker inspect c1

We can see under mounts "data" folder it located in the host machine.
Copy the path


/var/lib/docker/volumes/c5c85f87fdc3b46b57bb15f2473786fe7d49250227d1e9dc537bc594db001fc6/_data

Now, lets delete te container
# docker rm -f c1

After deleting the container, lets go to the location of the data folder

# cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/d867766f70722eaf8cba651bc1d64c60e9f49c5b1f1ebb9e781260f777f3c7e8/_data

# ls  ( we can see file1  file2 )

( Observe , the container is deleted but still  the data is persistant )

+++++++++++++

docker volume containers
-------------------------------
These are also known as reusable volume.
The volume used by one container can be shared with other containers.
Even if all the containers are deleted, data will still be available on the docker host.

Ex:

# sudo su -

Lets create a directory      /data
# mkdir  /data 

Lets Start  centos as container 
#  docker run --name  c1  -it  -v /data centos 
# ls  ( we can see the list of files and dir in centos )


# cd data
# ls  ( currently we have no files )

Lets create  some files
# touch file1  file2  ( These two files are available in c1 container)

Comeout of the container without exit
# Ctrl +p  Ctrl +q  ( container will still runs in background )


Lets Start another  centos as container ( c2 container should use the same volume as c1)
#  docker run --name  c2  -it  --volumes-from c1  centos 



# cd data
# ls  ( we can see the files created by c1 )

Lets create some more files
# touch file3  file4
# ls  ( we see 4 files )

Comeout of the container without exit
# Ctrl +p  Ctrl +q  ( container will still runs in background )

Lets Start another  centos as container
#  docker run --name  c3  -it  --volumes-from c2 centos 



# cd data
# ls  ( we can see 4 files )
# touch file5  file6
# ls

Comeout of the container without exit
# Ctrl +p  Ctrl +q  ( container will still runs in background )

Now, lets connect to any container which is running in the background
# docker attach  c1
#  ls  ( you can see all the files )
# exit

Identify the mount location
$ docker inspect  c1
( search for the mount section )

Take a note of the source path

/var/lib/docker/volumes/e22a9b39372615727b964151b6c8108d6c02b13114a3fcce255df0cee7609e15/_data



Lets remove all the container
# docker rm -f  c1  c2  c3

Lets go to the source path

# cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/e22a9b39372615727b964151b6c8108d6c02b13114a3fcce255df0cee7609e15/_data

Lets Start another  centos as container
#  docker run --name  c3  -it  --volumes-from c2 centos 









# cd data
# ls  ( we can see 4 files )
# touch file5  file6
# ls

Comeout of the container without exit
# Ctrl +p  Ctrl +q  ( container will still runs in background )

Now, lets connect to any container which is running in the background
# docker attach  c1
#  ls  ( you can see all the files )
# exit

Identify the mount location
$ docker inspect  c1
( search for the mount section )

Take a note of the source path

/var/lib/docker/volumes/4dcd29f66b45126f1aa739091c2933037868a5a3eadf41b1b4ca3ecabf5091c6/_data



Lets remove all the container
# docker rm -f  c1  c2  c3

Lets go to the source path

# cd  /var/lib/docker/volumes/4dcd29f66b45126f1aa739091c2933037868a5a3eadf41b1b4ca3ecabf5091c6/_data



# ls  ( we can see all the files )

Creating customized docker images
----------------------------------------

Whenever docker container is deleted, 
all the softwares that we have installed within the container will also be deleted.



If we can save the container as an image, then we can preserve the softwares.


This creation of customized docker images can be done in two ways.

1) using docker commit command
2) using docker file


Using docker commit
----------------------

# docker run  --name c1 -it  ubuntu


Update apt repository

# apt-get update
# apt-get install git
 
TO check the git
# git  --version
# exit

TO save the container as image (snapshot )
# docker commit   c1   myubuntu

To see the list of images
# docker images  ( you can see the image which you have created )

++++++++++++++++++++++
Now lets run the image which we have created
# docker run --name c2 -it   myubuntu


# git --version  ( git is pre installed )

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
